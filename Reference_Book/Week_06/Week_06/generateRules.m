function rules = generateRules(F,S,minConf)
%GENERATERULES returns the association rules found from the frequent
%itemsets based on the minimum confidence threshold |minConf|. 
%Association rules are expressed as {ante} => {conseq}.
%   |F| is a structure array of frequent itemsets
%   |S| is a Map object that maps itemsets to their support values
%   |rules| is a structure array of association rules that meet |minConf|
%   criteria, along with confidence, lift and support metrics.
