# Code used for "Data Sciende and Analysis" subject at UNED

This repository contains code samples for the different tasks required at the subject 
[Introducción a la Ciencia y el Análisis de Datos](https://portal.uned.es/portal/page?_pageid=93,71759483&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&idAsignatura=21580042&idTitulacion=215801)
Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED) for the academic year 2022-2023.

Different unrelated tasks had to be done, so different subdirectories have been employed:

- Tests: for the code employed in short online tests (1h) during the semester
- Reference_Book: for the scripts associated to the main text used in the subject [Data Science & 
Big Data Analytics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119183686)
- Tasks: intermediate tasks assigned during the semester implying generating random samples or analysing specific publicly available datasets with the methods studied during the course 
- Final_Project: final longer-scope project consisting on the analysis of author´s profile data uploaded to Strava platform (data not included) to find interesting relationships of general activity variables (i.e. power, distance, speed, elevation gain, bike employed...) as well as to analyse the GPX footprint and the potential privacy issues regarding home location identification using those GPS registers.
